## Plan

#### What am I coding

I'm mainly coding Python, using [PracticePython.org](https://practicepython.org), uploading my solutions to [this repository](https://github.com/ciurca/PracticePython). I may also use [Code Wars](https://codewars.com). I'm a beginner so that's why I'm doing these sorts of exercises right now.

#### Active Repositories

Repositories for things I'm coding during the #100DaysOfCode:
* [Practice Python exercises](https://github.com/ciurca/PracticePython)

#### Am I on track?

You can verify [here](r1-log.md) and if I missed a day please [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey%20%40raduciurca%2C%20did%20you%20just%20miss%20a%20day%20of%20%23100DaysOfCode%3F&) and let the world know!
