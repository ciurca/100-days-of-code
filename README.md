##Plan

####What am I coding

I'm mainly coding Python, using [PracticePython.org](https://practicepython.org), uploading my solutions to [this repository](https://github.com/ciurca/PracticePython). I may also use [Code Wars](https://codewars.com). I'm a beginner so that's why I'm doing these sorts of exercises right now.

####Active Repositories

Repositories for things I'm coding during the #100DaysOfCode:
* [Practice Python exercises](https://github.com/ciurca/PracticePython)
