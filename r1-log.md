## Log

### R1D1 
Did 2 exercises from [Practice Python](https://practicepython.org), you can check them out in [this repository](https://github.com/ciurca/PracticePython).

### R1D2
Did 5 exercises from [Practice Python](https://practicepython.org), looking good! Excited!

### R1D3

Did 2 exercises from [Practice Python](https://practicepython.org), almost did three, but the third one is still bugging me! I'll probably solve it later today. Good stuff!

### R1D4

Made a website that has all the workouts/exercises from [@mattdavella](@witter.com/mattdavella)'s workout video. Check it out [here](http://ciurca.github.io).
(not: the site is pretty buggy on computers, but it works well on mobile)

### R1D5

Made a Python Script that sends Whatsapp messages when a certain user types a message into a group. I got it after [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whatsapp-using-python/) tutorial, and edited it a bit. It was fun.

### R1D6

Made a Python Script that checks Facebook, Instagram and Twitter whether or not I have new notifications.

### R1D7

Made a simple Python program that sends me a simple Windows notification every 30 minutes minutes telling me to stretch and when clicked, it opens up a website with stretching exercises.
