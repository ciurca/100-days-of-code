Mixed it up today, did Python and JavaScript exercises from [Codewars](https://codewars.com).

### R1D21

Did all the basic #JavaScript exercises from #W3Schools. 
I couldn't have done this without exercising #Python for some time, knowing the basic concepts of programming. The only problem was JS syntax, but I caught on pretty quickly.
